Say you have an array for which the _i_<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.

**Note:**  
 You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
