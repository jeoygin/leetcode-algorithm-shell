Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

For `"(()"`, the longest valid parentheses substring is `"()"`, which has length = 2.

Another example is `")()())"`, where the longest valid parentheses substring is `"()()"`, which has length = 4.
