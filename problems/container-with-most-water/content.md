Given _n_ non-negative integers _a<sub>1</sub>_, _a<sub>2</sub>_, ..., _a<sub>n</sub>_, where each represents a point at coordinate (_i_, _a<sub>i</sub>_). _n_ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line _i_ is at (_i_, _a<sub>i</sub>_) and (_i_, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.
