You are given a string, **S** , and a list of words, **L** , that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.

For example, given:  
**S** : `"barfoothefoobarman"`  
**L** : `["foo", "bar"]`

You should return the indices: `[0,9]`.  
 (order does not matter).
