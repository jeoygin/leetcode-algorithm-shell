Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Note:**  
 A solution using O(_n_) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?  

confused what `"{1,#,2,3}"` means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.

  
  
**OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:**

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:

    1
      / \
     2 3
        /
       4
        \
         5

 The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.
