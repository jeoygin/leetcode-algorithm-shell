Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s** , find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ **s**. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array `[2,3,1,2,4,3]` and `s = 7`,  
 the subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the _O_(_n_) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is _O_(_n_ log _n_).
