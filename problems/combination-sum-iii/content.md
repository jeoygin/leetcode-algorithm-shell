Find all possible combinations of _ **k** _ numbers that add up to a number _ **n** _, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

Ensure that numbers within the set are sorted in ascending order.

  
  

_ **Example 1:** _

Input: _ **k** _ = 3, _ **n** _ = 7

Output:

    [[1,2,4]]

  
  

_ **Example 2:** _

Input: _ **k** _ = 3, _ **n** _ = 9

Output:

    [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
