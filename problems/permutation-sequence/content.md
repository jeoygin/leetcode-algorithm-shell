The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,n]` contains a total of _n_! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,  
 We get the following sequence (ie, for _n_ = 3):

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given _n_ and _k_, return the _k_<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given _n_ will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
