Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k** th smallest element in it.

**Note:**  
 You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**  
 What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

1. Try to utilize the property of a BST.
2. What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
3. The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
