The _n_-queens puzzle is the problem of placing _n_ queens on an _n_Ã—_n_ chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer _n_, return all distinct solutions to the _n_-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the _n_-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,  
 There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

    [
     [".Q..", // Solution 1
      "...Q",
      "Q...",
      "..Q."],
    
    
     ["..Q.", // Solution 2
      "Q...",
      "...Q",
      ".Q.."]
    ]
