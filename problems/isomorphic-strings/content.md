Given two strings **_s_** and **_t_** , determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in **_s_** can be replaced to get **_t_**.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,  
 Given `"egg"`, `"add"`, return true.

Given `"foo"`, `"bar"`, return false.

Given `"paper"`, `"title"`, return true.

**Note:**  
 You may assume both **_s_** and **_t_** have the same length.
