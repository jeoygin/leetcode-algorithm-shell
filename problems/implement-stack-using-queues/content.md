Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

-  push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
-  pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
-  top() -- Get the top element.
-  empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
**Notes:**  

- You must use _only_ standard operations of a queue -- which means only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

 The class name of the **Java** function had been updated to **MyStack** instead of Stack.
