Given a linked list, remove the _n_<sup>th</sup> node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

    Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
    
    
       After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

**Note:**  
 Given _n_ will always be valid.  
 Try to do this in one pass.
